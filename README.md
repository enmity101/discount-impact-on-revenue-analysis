# 📊 Revenue & Discount Impact Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes revenue performance and identifies the key reason behind declining revenue despite stable customer traffic.

The analysis shows that while the number of customers remained consistent over time, overall revenue decreased due to excessive discounting. High discount rates reduced the average revenue per customer and negatively impacted profitability.
